# Portfolio

## Description

This portfolio is going to be used to showcase my own work as I am going through this Bootcamp, and I wanted to be able to show my skills in HTML and CSS while doing so. I was able to gain alot of knowledge in the options CSS has to offer, as well as the best ways to do research for Web Development.

## Usage

This Porfolio site has links that can quickly scroll to the information that you need, such as the contact information. And, although I personnaly do not have enough work of my own to showcase at the moment, this site will easily take you to any work that will be done by clicking on the pictures in the porfolio section. (Right now the links will take you to some prework done, our first challenge website, and the Website to sign up for this bootcamp.)
